Thank you for installing the Tactical Exercise Without Troops (TEWT).
To use the software, click the start menu, scroll to the "Cubic" folder
and click on the "TEWT Server" software, then either:

1. Open a browser window (preferably Chrome), 
   and type "http://<ipaddress>:7010" in the address bar
   where <ipaddress> the address of your system OR localhost when the server
   is on the same computer

Regards,

Mitchell Day
