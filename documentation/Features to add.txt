- Need a portable db that contains user credentials
- create a proper form that posts the user data to the server, the server then returns an object 
    - {error: false, data: {string: "Successfully logged in", serverAuthToken: dfdsdsgfffffffffgfds"}
    - static auth token 


Code Cleanup
- Split all the code into set modules that are for each component.

- System
    - Config -> load(read), save Config
    - User -> login, logout, getAuth, changePassword

- Devices
    - findAllDevices, findDevices, add, remove, edit
    - 

- nx-witness
    - Server needs to do all commands to nx
        - server will need to do basic/digest authentication and save cookies


- network
